This repository contains the Pest Plugin for Drupal.

**NOTE** Leveraging existing PHPUnit test case base classes (beyond UnitTestCase) is not possible due to Drupal defaulting
to test isolation. For contex see https://github.com/pestphp/pest/issues/665 and https://github.com/pestphp/pest/issues/618.
